# fuzzy_coclustering
Source code for "A fuzzy co-clustering of users and items based on NMF for recommender systems" papre

This code uses surprise package which works with Linux OS. However, with python 3.5+ you can run this code on windows too.
Using "interface.py" testing the algorithm is easier by modifying:
"""
merges = ['M1', 'M2', 'M3']
methods = ['SVD', 'SVDp', 'base', 'normal']
algorithms = ['FCNMF','FUIS']
"""
Additionally other recommender systerms are avalable here. Yet, we used methods with better performance on "Movielens" Dataset (which also is avalable here).
